# Quick Pick Lotto Documentation

### Technical Stack / Considerations
- Spring boot
- OpenApi / Swagger
- Junit Tests

My assumptions are:

- A ticket contains a collection of unique games.
- QuickPick ticket is accessed by specifying the number of games using this URL: `http://localhost:8080/quickpick/5`
- A single game contains 7 unique numbers.
